                    <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites
                         for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
                          interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding
                           programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. 
                        The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</p>

                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS,
                         is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                          CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent
                           of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors,
                            fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers 
                        define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.</p>
